        <h1>Our History</h1>
        <p class="update-date">Last updated: January 2025</p>
        <hr size="1" noshade="1"><br>
        <h2>1. How We Started</h2>
        <p>Our company began with a simple idea: to provide everyday essentials that combine practicality with creativity. Starting with a small collection of stationery items, we worked tirelessly to design products that students, professionals, and creatives could rely on.</p>
        <h2>2. How Many Years</h2>
        <p>For over 5 years , we’ve grown from a small local supplier into a trusted brand. Each year has been a step forward, expanding our product line to include backpacks, colored markers/highlighters, pencil cases, laptop cases, and glasses.</p>
        <h2>3. Our Struggles</h2>
        <p>Like many growing businesses, we faced challenges — from sourcing quality materials to building trust in a competitive market. There were times when resources were limited, and every order felt like a milestone. But our persistence, attention to detail, and commitment to customer satisfaction kept us moving forward.</p>
        <h2>4. Our Success</h2>
        <p>Through dedication and innovation, we transformed those struggles into success. Today, our products are recognized for their quality, durability, and style. We’ve built strong relationships with schools, offices, and creative communities, becoming more than just a stationery brand — we are a lifestyle companion.</p>
        <h2>5. Customer Recommendations</h2>
        <p>Our greatest achievement is the trust of our customers. Many recommend us to friends, colleagues, and family because they value our reliable products, eco‑friendly options, and personalized service. Their support has been the driving force behind our growth and inspires us to keep improving every day.</p>
